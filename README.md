#GermanDW Hack

This tool can manipulate the results (percentage, exercise count, etc.) of a `learngerman.dw` exercise.
I made this for my german homework.

### How?
I use the selenium python library to open a chrome or firefox web browser, then scrape & interact with the
data from the provided `learngerman.dw` exercise.

### Installation
This tool requires that you have Python 3 installed. You can acquire the package dependencies from 
[here](dependencies.txt). There are currently no executable binaries.

When run, the script shows a simple CLI interface which prompts you to enter information about the results
you want.
